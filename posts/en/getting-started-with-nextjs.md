# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized how developers build React applications by providing a powerful framework that handles many of the complex configurations and optimizations needed for production-ready apps.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- Built-in CSS and Sass support
- Code splitting and bundling
- Fast refresh
- TypeScript support out of the box

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is incredibly simple. You just need to have Node.js installed on your machine (version 12.22.0 or later).

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with a default template and start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Pages and Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

For example:
- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug`

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for fetching data:

### getStaticProps (Static Generation)

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: { data }, // Will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

### getServerSideProps (Server-side Rendering)

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data?id=${context.params.id}`)
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: { data }, // Will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with all the features you need for production. It's a great choice for building modern web applications, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features of Next.js such as API routes, authentication, and deployment strategies.
