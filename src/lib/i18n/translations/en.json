Alongside the Natural Disasters mod, I was asked to work on a Mission system, containing several features such as:<ul><li>Daily personal missions</li><li>Daily global contracts</li><li>Mission teams for events</li><li>Customizable shop system</li></ul>All of these features were requested on very short notice and developed in the span of 3 days.<br/>This mission and shop system continued to be used on the main server for a while and in the second time the event happened.<br/>Working here, I learned more to work as part of a team, how to communicate more effectively with team members, how to find creative solutions to difficult problems and work around limitations.</p>"

The Castor Odyssey is scientific initiation project from UFU (Federal University of Uberlândia) which was shortly described as \"A Customizable Escape Game-Like Based on Computational Thinking Categorization\" in the paper submitted to CISTI (Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technology).<br/>The game is a series of mini-games based on exercises from the Bebras Challenge, and completing each mini-game will provide the player with an item for a picnic taking place in the forest, where many species of animals will attend. Each mini-game was developed in teams of two.<br/>The mini-game I participaed in developing is founded on pattern recognition, where the player must analyse three sandwiches and their ingredients described by letters and find the combination of ingredients requested by one of the animals.</p>"
